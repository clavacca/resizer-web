      ## Overview
      The core and [18 plugins](/plugins/free) are free and open-source. No restrictions, no money, and no strings attached. They are provided under [a modified MIT license called the Freedom license](/licenses/freedom). 

      Development of this project is funded by people purchasing [the enhanced editions (which include additional plugins)](/buy) and [support contracts](/support/contracts).

      Every licenese has been written to provide maximum freedom, minimum restrictions, and maximum simplicity. 99% of use cases should be covered. If yours is not, e-mail **sales@imageresizing.net**. Please note we will not sell plugins individually.

      ## Sales FAQ

    dl
      dt
        | Q: Can I buy plugins individually?
      dd No &mdash; they're designed to work together, and it would cause customer confusion and hassle.

      dt
        | Q: Can I upgrade from one license to another? 
      dd 
        | Our offline license keys can't be changed, which makes this impossible. We encourage you to select a license  appropriate for your future needs when possible.
      dt 
        | Q: What can I use for free?
      dd 
        markdown:
