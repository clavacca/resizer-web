h1 Design bundle

markdown: 
  This bundle gives you tremendous flexibility for a very low price point. The Watermark and SimpleFilters plugins are medium-trust compatible.

  - Get a 2-4x speed boost by using WIC instead of GDI (requires full trust)
  - Go nuts with your RAW files, PSD files, and apply advanced filters you'd only expect from Photoshop.
  - Overlay (or underlay) multiple text and image layers with the Watermark plugin - anything is possible.
  - Auto-trim your product photos with WhitespaceTrimmer, or use SeamCarving to magically change the aspect ratio of images by slicing seams of pixels from background (low-energy) areas of the image.
